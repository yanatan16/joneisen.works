# Jon Eisen

### Principal Engineer and Architect

I love to build software that people use to do their jobs. I am an experienced polyglot generalist programmer. I have built everything from high performance embedded computing systems to high scalability web services and distributed systems. I've soloed for extended periods and led cross-functional teams. I've worked in many industries, but the through-line of my career has been solving problems with technology as a solution.

Functional programming is my preferred style, even in more imperative languages. Defensive design, exhaustive testing, extensive automation, and self-documenting APIs are all habits of mine. I think a programmer's greatest skill is writing readable code.

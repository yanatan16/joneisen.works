    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have built and shipped high scalability web services, REST APIs, websocket-based services, eCommerce platforms, front-end single page applications (in Reagent, React, Backbone, Angular, and custom frameworks), third-party javascript widgets, developer deployment tooling, system-wide containerization, cluster administration, and more. I am familiar with both functional (Clojure, Haskell, etc) and imperative languages (Java, Python, etc).
    </p>

    <p>
      In past lives, I have worked for a marketing SAAS firm, an eCommerce apparel company, and a defense contractor.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love trail running, hiking, and rock climbing. I drink a fair share of craft brews, and even brew my own on occassion.
